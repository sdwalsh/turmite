# Turmites #

Turmites is a small Go program that runs one more more [turmites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite) through a mound.

Turmite library located at github.com/sdwalsh/turmites/mounds

Every turmite is a 2d turing machine, one of the most famous turmites being [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) (a four state turing machine).

## How do I get set up? ##

* Linux/Unix-like OS required
* `bash`, `rm`, `ffmpeg` required for `func mound.BatchImages(...)`

## Things to consider ##

* Currently every frame is encoded into png files into a temporary directory. This takes a long time!
* `mound.BatchImages(...)` currently handles a max of 999,999 frames
* Want to convert .mp4 to .gif? Consider [this](https://superuser.com/questions/556029/how-do-i-convert-a-video-to-gif-using-ffmpeg-with-reasonable-quality) Stack Overflow post
* API is not stable and subject to change

## TODO ##

* Modify `mound.BatchImages(...)` to start generating pngs at a specific step (currently steps from frame 1 -> frame 999,999)
* Create function to merge various .mp4s
* Allow skipping of frames
* Allow user to choose output type (currently only allows .mp4)
* Consider pushing png encoding to different cores (currently the bottleneck)

## Who do I talk to? ##

* Contact Sean @ [github.com/sdwalsh](https://www.github.com/sdwalsh) or [bitbucket.org/sdwalsh](https://www.bitbucket.org/sdwalsh)
